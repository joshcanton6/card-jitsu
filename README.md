## Rules

Both players start with 5 cards. Each card consists of a number, an element, and a color. During each round, both players will play a card from their hand face-down into the play area. After both cards are set, reveal them and determine the winner.

Fire always beats snow, which always beats water, which always beats fire. If both cards are the same element, then the highest number wins. In the case of a tie, neither player wins and play resumes to the next round. Some cards also have powerful effects, as shown below.

## Winning

There are 3 ways to win the match.
- You can score each of fire, water, and snow, in different colors.
- You can score 3 of the same element in different colors.
- If your opponent cannot play a card due to the effect of a power card with blocking effects.
